		<p>please remember to use branches rather than committing to master.</p>
		<p>actually i'm pretty sure you can't commit to master without me checking the merge but still PLEASE DON'T!</p>
		<p>also please use vs code + learn the basics of emmet syntax it'll make ur life so much easier
		<p style="color: grey">".col-4" turns into &lt;div class="col-4"&gt; which is extremely helpful for bootstrap work</p>
		<p>alright cool have fun go nuts</p>
